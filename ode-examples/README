This directory contains sample input files for `ode', originally written by
Nicholas B. Tufillaro 1982-1994 <nbt@reed.edu>.  GNU enhancements by

Documentation, and instructions on how to run `ode' and display the
resulting output, appears at the head of each file.

The documentation in each of the files refers to `graph-X', the tool for
plotting in a window on an X Window System display.  You may substitute
`graph-ps' to obtain Postscript output, `graph-tek' to draw the plot in a
Tektronix window, and so forth.

The file lunar.sh is an executable shell script which calls `ode', rather
than an `ode' input file.
