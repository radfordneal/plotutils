This directory contains the source for the GNU version of the `graph'
program.

The build process creates five versions of this program: graph-X, graph-ps,
graph-fig, graph-tek, and raw graph [which produces output in a
GNU-enhanced version of the traditional plot(5) format].  They differ from
one another in the graphics device they are able to drive.  During the
build process, they are linked with different version of GNU libplot.
