These programs implement the methods described in the paper "Fast
Exact Summation Using Small and Large Superaccumulators", by Radford
M. Neal, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05571, and also here
as xsum-paper.pdf, and can be used to reproduce the results therein.

The programs are licensed under the "MIT" license, which is in the
file "LICENSE".


The programs can be built using one of the several Makefiles included.
For instance, the following should work on Linux systems with gcc
installed:

    make -f Makefile-gcc-intel

See the documentation at the start of the Makefile-xxx files for more
details.  For some systems, another Makefile may need to be created.
Performance on a particular system may be improved by tuning compiler
options, and perhaps the settings of the flags defined at the
beginning of the xsum.c file.

The xsum-check program does automatic correctness checks.  The
xsum-test program can be used to test the functions manually.  The
xsum-time program does timing tests. The xsum-time-perm program does
the same timing tests but with data randomly permuted.

The xsum-time-zhu and xsum-time-perm-zhu programs do timing tests that
include times for the iFastSum and OnlineExact methods of Zhu and
Hayes (ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Algorithm 908).
Making this program requires their ExactSum.cpp and ExactSum.h source
files, from the supplemental information for their paper (found at
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1824801.1824815).  A C++ compiler is
also needed.  If you have all this, you can compile them (and the
other programs) using the with-zhu make target.

The programs can be remade by using the "compile" script, which runs
make -B to recompile them with the makefile with a specified suffix.
It also stores information on the git commit, diffs from that commit,
and how they were compiled in Make-info.  The "compile-zhu" script
does the same with the Zhu and Hayes programs also compiled.

The checks and timing tests reported in the paper can be run with the
run-tests-zhu script (except that the tests of sizes 10 and 100 were
done with fewer repetitions on the Raspberry Pi, to avoid very long
runs).  The run-checks script runs only the correctness checks.

In the directory paper-results, the systems on which tests were done
are described in the files with names of the form system-xxx, and the
results are in corresponding files named results-xxx-ccc, where ccc is
the compiler used.  The plots in the paper are also there, produced by
the plots.r script.
