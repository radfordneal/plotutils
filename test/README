This directory contains the files needed for validation tests of several of
the plot utilities.  The tests are run by doing `make check' in the
top-level directory, or by doing `make test' in this directory.

There are a couple of additional tests you can run; see the instructions at
the head of the Makefile.

Validation tests on NeXT machines have been known to fail for innocuous
reasons (incorrect formatting of floating-point numbers).  If any of the
tests should fail on any other system, please report it.
