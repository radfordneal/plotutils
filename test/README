This directory contains the files needed for validation tests of several of
the plot utilities.  The tests are run by doing `make check'.

Each .test script generates an .out output file, which is compared with the
corresponding .xout (`expected output') file.  If there are any significant
differences, the test fails.

Validation tests on NeXT machines have been known to fail for more or less
innocuous reasons (incorrect formatting of floating-point numbers).  If any
of the tests should fail on any other system, please report it.
