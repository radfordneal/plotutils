This directory contains the files needed for validation tests of several of
the plot utilities.  The tests are run by doing `make check'.

Validation tests on NeXT machines have been known to fail for more or less
innocuous reasons (incorrect formatting of floating-point numbers).  If any
of the tests should fail on any other system, please report it.

HOW THE TESTS ARE DONE

Each .test script generates an .out output file, which is compared with the
corresponding .xout (`expected output') file.  If there are any significant
differences, the test fails.

SPECIAL FEATURES

As a workaround for line end problems when installing with DJGPP under DOS,
all occurrences of ^M in the .out file are removed before doing the
comparison, yielding a .dos file.  (This removal should have no effect on
other platforms.)

The plot2hpgl.test file compares against either plot2hpgl.xout or
plot2hpgl.yout.  The latter is used if the `--enable-ps-fonts-in-pcl'
option was passed to `configure'.  In that case a different comparison file
is needed, because `--enable-ps-fonts-in-pcl' allows the output from `plot
-Thpgl' to contain any of the 35 PS fonts, such as Times-Roman.
