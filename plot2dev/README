This directory contains the source for GNU versions of the traditional
plot(5) filters.  Each filter consists of a driver routine, which is linked
with the appropriate version of GNU libplot.  The driver routine reads
directives in a GNU-enhanced version of plot(5) format, and translates
them, via libplot, to the graphics commands for the appropriate display
device.

There are five filters: plot2X, plot2ps, plot2fig, plot2tek, and plot2plot.
plot2plot looks redundant, but is not; it can be used to translate among
different types of plot(5) format.  There are two basic types (the
traditional binary format, and a newer ascii format).  Also, the
traditional binary format came in two varieties (for high-endian and
low-endian machines).  plot2plot can translate among these formats.
