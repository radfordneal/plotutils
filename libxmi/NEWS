Version 1.1 released, 7/99.  (First official GNU release.)

Changed first argument of miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas from (miPaintedSet *)
to (const miPaintedSet *).

Fixed a bug that caused miDrawPoints() to segfault from when called on a
set consisting of only one point.

Fixed a bug in miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas() that was leading to intermittent
null pointer dereferencing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0 released, 6/99.

Wrote a texinfo manual.

Added support for triangular joins, of both polylines and polyarcs.
Triangular caps are now supported too, but only for polyarcs.  Triangular
joins and caps are defined as in HP-GL/2.

Added miGCSetAttribs() function, to set multiple GC attributes with a
single function call.

Changed names of values of enumerated variables defined in xmi.h to modern
style (e.g. changed miJoinMiter to MI_JOIN_MITER).

In declarations of miSetPixelMerge{2|3}, changed typedef'd datatype of
second argument (miPixelMerge{2|3}) from a function to a pointer to a
function, for compatibility with very old C compilers.
