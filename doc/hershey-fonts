The following are excerpts from Allen Hershey's 1967 technical report,
`Calligraphy for Computers'.  They explain the origin of many of the
Hershey fonts now supported by GNU libplot.  The names of the fonts have
been modernized.

"[The two HersheySans fonts] are adaptations of the alphabets on Le Roy
lettering sets.  [The four HersheySerif fonts, the Greek characters in the
Hershey symbol fonts, and the Cyrillic characters in HersheyCyrillic] are
adaptations of the alphabets to be observed in newspapers, text books, and
dictionaries. (1,2)"

"[The two HersheyScript fonts] been adapted from a Headliner Typemaster of
the Varityper Corporation.  [HersheyGothic-English] has been adapted from a
Le Roy lettering set for Old English...  [HersheyGothic-Italian] represents
a large family of alphabets for which there does not seem to be a
consistent nomenclature.  Some writers refer to it as Gothic uncial while
others call it Lombardic Gothic.  It seems to have been developed in
Lombardy while the best examples (3,4) come from Spain.  The present
version is an adaptation of a font [the `Missal Initials' font] of the
American Type Founders Company (5)...  [HersheyGothic-German] is an
adaptation of Fraktur (6)."
