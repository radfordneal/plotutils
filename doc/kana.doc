The following table displays the encodings for the Japanese Kana, or
syllabic characters (Hiragana and Katakana), which are built into GNU
libplot.  They were digitized by Dr. Allen V. Hershey of the U.S. Naval
Surface Weapons Center (Dahlgren, VA) in the mid-1960s.  For details, see
his technical report "Calligraphy for Computers".  (Available from the
U.S. National Technical Information Service at +1 703 487 4650; ask for
item number AD662398.)

These Kana are part of the HersheyEUC font, which is employed for drawing
multibyte Japanese text strings.  But you may also use these Kana while
drawing text strings in any other Hershey font, by inserting the
appropriate escape sequences.

There are 83 Hiragana (cursive characters) and 86 Katakana (block
characters).  The Hiragana and Katakana are indexed in the table below as
the bytes 0x21..0x73 and 0x21..0x76, respectively.  A transliteration of
each Kana is included in the table.

The indexing of the Kana is specified in the JIS X0208 standard.  Actually,
in that standard the Hiragana appear as 0x2421..0x2473 and the Katakana
appear as 0x2521..0x2576.  For full information on the JIS standard, see
"Understanding Japanese Information Processing", by Ken Lunde (O'Reilly,
1993).

To draw Hiragana `a', indexed as 0x22 below, you would use the escape
sequence "\#J2422".  To draw Katakana `a', you would use the escape
sequence "\#J2522".  These escape sequences would be valid whenever the
current font is a non-Japanese Hershey font.  By using the table below, you
should find it easy to draw a phonetic representation of most Japanese
words, syllable by syllable.

You should be aware that in Japanese, many words are normally written with
ideographic characters (Kanji) rather than Kana.  However, any Japanese
word may be rendered (possibly inelegantly) in terms of Kana.  For example,
"Mitsubishi" would be mi-tsu-bi-shi, i.e., "\#J245f\#J2444\#J2453\#J2437"
in terms of Hiragana.

You are cautioned that there are some special rules for combinations of
sounds, e.g. consonant + diphthong.  The `small' Kana are used for such
combinations.  Also, the `small tsu' Kana before a Kana beginning with the
consonant k, s, t, or p is interpreted not as a syllable, but as a sign
that that consonant should be doubled.
