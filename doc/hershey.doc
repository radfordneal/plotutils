In GNU libplot, the original `occidental' Hershey glyphs are available via
escape sequences in the range "\#H0001" to "\#H3926", with many gaps.  They
fall into the following groups:

0001--0284	alphanumeric symbols, cartographic [small] size
0501--0746	alphanumeric symbols, principal [large] size
0750--0909	centered symbols
0910--0910	alphanumeric symbols, principal [large] size
1001--1295	alphanumeric symbols, indexical [medium] size
1401--2312	alphanumeric symbols, principal [large] size
2317--2382	centered symbols
2401--3926	alphanumeric symbols, principal [large] size

`Alphanumeric symbols' means not just alphabetic symbols and numerals, but
also punctuation marks, mathematical symbols, etc.; in general, any symbol
that can be viewed as having a well-defined `baseline', and which could
appear in a string of characters resting on that baseline.

`Centered symbols' are different.  In practice they would seldom be
displayed in such a way that they are resting on a baseline.  Instead, they
would be drawn so as to be centered on a specified point.  Also, they would
seldom appear in a string.  An example would be the `sand' symbol, Hershey
glyph #0764, which is clearly designed to be drawn on a map rather than to
appear in text.

In the original distributions of the Hershey glyphs, no distinction was
made between alphanumeric symbols and centered symbols.  That was possible
because in the coordinate system used by Dr. Hershey, all are centered on
the point (0,0).  The `baseline' concept was not used.  Each alphanumeric
symbols had a well-defined baseline, but the baselines differed for the
three sizes.

In GNU libplot, when strings are drawn with the alabel() function, e.g.,
when GNU `graph' labels axes, a baseline must be chosen.  For alphanumeric
symbols of all kinds and also centered symbols, we have chosen it to be the
baseline appropriate for the principal [large] size alphanumeric symbols.
This determines a choice of vertical elevation of each symbol, when it is
rendered as an element of a string.

If the `x' option to alabel() is used, to place characters on a baseline,
the vertical elevation may not be appropriate for indexical [medium] and
cartographic [small] alphanumeric symbols.  But nowadays the indexical and
cartographic glyphs are seldom accessed.  The only reason for drawing
smaller characters is to draw superscripts and subscripts, and our
rendering algorithm uses miniaturized principal-size characters for that.

If you are using the alabel() function to display strings, you may specify
the `c' option to obtain vertical centering, as well as the `x' option to
place characters on a baseline.  You would use the `c' option to place a
centered symbol at a specified point.  For example, the function call

	alabel ('c', 'c', "\#H0764")

would place the `sand' symbol at the current position.  The two arguments
`c' and `c' request both horizontal and vertical centering.
