The subdirectories of this directory contain the source for the several
version of GNU libplot: libplotX, libplotps, libplotfig, libplottek, and
raw libplot.

Each file in the subdirectory `common' is part of more than one library.
Links are made to the files in `common' at compile time, and they are
removed when you do a `make clean'.
