Robert Maier <rsm@math.arizona.edu> wrote libplot, graph, and plot,
beginning in 1995.  The old `GNU graphics' package (written by Rich Murphey
<rich@lamprey.utmb.edu> in 1989-1991) served as a starting point, but the
plotutils package is an order of magnitude larger.  Probably none of the
code from the earlier package remains in libplot or graph.

spline and double were originally written by Rich.  They have been extended
by Robert, but some of Rich's code is still present.

Current versions of tek2plot are based on the Tektronix parser written by
Edward Moy <moy@parc.xerox.com> in the mid-1980's at Berkeley, which was
later included in the X11 distribution.

ode was written by Nick Tufillaro <nbt@reed.edu> in 1978-1994, and has been
somewhat modified and extended so as to merge it into this package.

Robert wrote the texinfo manual (the chapter on ode draws heavily on Nick's
original ode documentation, which dates back to the late 1970s).
