Filling of regions (i.e., the polygonal regions whose vertices are the data
points), when requested by the -q option, works as long as the regions are
entirely within the plotting box.  Filling does not work properly if the
regions extend outside the box, since the clipping algorithm which is used
is appropriate for unfilled regions only.  This will be fixed in a later
release.

libplot's HP-GL driver and applications that produce HP-GL output
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The as yet undocumented `Arc' and `Stick' fonts, which show up when you do
`--help-fonts' or `--list-fonts' in addition to `-T hpgl', are only
partially implemented.  They are vector fonts that are resident in
HP plotters and HP LaserJets.  

HP-GL/2 output containing these fonts should be rendered perfectly on
LaserJets.  But in HP-GL output for an HP7550A plotter or compatible device
(produced by setting the environment variable HPGL_VERSION to "1.5"),
labels in any of the Arc fonts may be incorrectly placed.  That is because
in the HP7550A and other HP plotters, the Arc fonts are kerned.  libplot
does not yet compensate for this automatic kerning.
