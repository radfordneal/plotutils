Version 3.1, 2020-12-??:

Still in development...

Changes in this version are largely aimed at making the 'graph'
program work better for interactively displaying data produced by
other programs.  With the new facilities in this release, a
pipeline of the following form is recommended for this:

    program | graph -TX --no-input --wait --new-defaults

These options can of course be included automatically using either a
shell alias or a shell script.

Details of changes:

graph:   

* There is a new --wait (or -i) command-line option, relevant only for
  X Window display (with -TX).  If it is set, the 'graph' program will
  wait until the plot window has been closed by the user before
  exitting (or the user may terminate the program manually, e.g., with
  Control-C).

* There is a new --no-input comand-line option, relevant only for X
  Window display (with -TX).  If it is set, keyboard and mouse input
  not accepted from the plot window. This avoids accidently closing
  the window with a stray mouse click (or by typing 'q'), and also
  prevents focus from moving to the plot window, away from the window
  used to issue the 'graph' command, which would often be inconvenient.

* A new set of default plot parameters can now be enabled with the
  --new-defaults (or -n) command-line option.  These defaults improve
  the aesthetics of plots and reduce wasted space.  They are
  especially appropriate for plotting in an X window.

* There is a new --points or -p command-line option, which has the
  effect of -m -1 and -S 16 POINT_SIZE/100, where POINT_SIZE if the
  optional argument of --points (default 3).  This is convenient for 
  specifying that the plot should have points only, without lines.

* When axis labels are in scientific notation, the times sign is now
  represented by an "x" character.  This avoids some spacing anomolies
  that occur when the actual times symbol is used.  Trailing zeros
  after a decimal point in the mantissa are now suppressed.  The
  spacing in this notation is now also slightly more compact.

* The text and numeric labels on the vertical axis is now slightly
  closer to the axis.

* Fixed a bug in which optional arguments immediately after one-letter 
  options were not handled properly.  (E.g, -S17 now works properly.)

libplot: 

* The API for X Plotters now has a new WAIT_ON_DELETE parameter, which
  if set to "yes" causes a window delete operation to wait until the
  window or windows that were popped up are closed by the user. The
  default is "no" (the old behaviour).

* The API for X Plotters now has a new NO_INPUT parameter, which if
  set to "yes" suppresses mouse and keyboard input. This also prevents
  input focus from moving to the plot window. The default is "no", in
  which case typing 'q' or clicking the mouse in the window causes it
  to close.

* The process spawned to handle events for an X Window will now no
  longer display any error messages. These previously appeared at
  times such as when the user manual closed the window.


Version 3.0, 2020-11-30:

This release is functionally identical to GNU plotutils 2.6, except
for some bug fixes.  Some fixes are from the Debian version, and
others are new to plutitls+.
