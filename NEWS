Major improvements to process of configuration and building (thanks
	to Nelson Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>, many new configs now work).
Validation test of plot2fig no longer fails on some systems due to
	innocuous causes (sign differences).  This does not include NeXT's,
	which format floating point numbers in a genuinely nonstandard way.
Output of libplotfig and graph-fig now indicates (via comment lines)
	which ellipse objects are circles.
Bugs in support for MS-DOS kermit's Tektronix emulation fixed: initial drawing
	color now is white, background black.  TERM="kermit", "kterm"
	now recognized.  Linemodes 3, 4 no longer incorrectly swapped.
Library linking (if Athena widgets used) is now -lXmu -lXt, not the reverse.
ode: improvements to arithemetic exception handling (error or warning message
	now always printed).
ode/specfun.c: `signgam' variable declared and used properly.
Problems with pointers to signed vs. unsigned chars, which gave problems
	on overly strict ANSI or pseudo-ANSI compilers, fixed.

Version 1.2 released, 9/97

Problems with 8-bit characters (`8-bit uncleanliness') fixed in libplot.
	In `graph', they affected the drawing of axis labels containing 8-bit
	characters.
graph: buggy --reposition option fixed.
--with-motif configuration option added, for systems (e.g. HP/UX) with
	Motif widgets but not Athena widgets.
libplotps (and e.g. graph-ps) output is now conformant EPS, version 3.0.
	No more spare dictionary left on the PS stack, which interfered
	with inclusion as an EPS file and importing into xfig.
Escape sequences which allow access to Greek characters and mathematical
	symbols (e.g. "\*a", which means `alpha') now work in graph-X
	and in general in libplotX even if the current font is a non-builtin
	(user-specified) X font.
libplotX: switching among builtin PS fonts in a single label 
	was causing slightly incorrect estimates for the label width, 
	with not-so-good horizontal justification as a result (visible 
	e.g. in graph-X labels).  Fixed.
raw libplot: functions that take a string argument no longer try to
	write into the string.
graph: when labelling ticks along an axis with large or small numbers (printed 
	in exponent form, i.e. FOOx10^BAR), zero is now printed just
	as `0', not as 0.0x10^0.
graph: FOOx10^BAR form for tick labels now works even when current font
	is a symbol font.
graph: identical upper and lower limits on an axis no longer cause an
	error message and an abort. Instead each limit is displaced
	by 1 unit, with a warning message.
graph: -s option (--save-screen) now works.  (Meaningful only for
	graph-tek and raw graph.)
libplotfig: later-drawn objects, of whatever kind, now appear in front
	of (rather than behind) earlier-drawn objects.  This has
	implications for graph-fig (it fixes a bug previously mentioned in the
	PROBLEMS file).
graph: new --frame-color option (sets name of color of frame, and plotted
	curves too if -C option is not used)
New libplot functions: pencolorname(), fillcolorname(), colorname(),
	which search a database of color names (orig. from X11R6 rgb.txt).
New libplot function: pencolor().  color() now just calls it and fillcolor().
plot filters: bug in parsing of fmarkerrel() op code fixed.
plot filters (plot2X etc.) now abort instead of just printing a warning,
	if an unrecognized directive is seen in the input stream.
	This is to avoid confusing ascii-format input streams with
	binary-format input streams (which can cause X servers to crash).
Regression tests in ./test reworked; different options now used
	on `graph', in the tests.  Output is more visually pleasing.
ode-examples directory reworked; examples are documented and some
	are renamed.
ode arithmetic exception handling improved.
Separate ascii-format doc on ode (originally nroff) merged into texinfo
	doc, heavily edited.
In ./ode, gram.c, gram.tab.h and lex.c are no longer removed during
	a `make distclean'.  This is for the benefit
	of people who may not have bison or yacc.  If you want to
	re-make them, you should do a `make realclean'.  The
	info/plotutils.info documentation file and test/*.xout
	are similarly not removed except in a `make realclean'.
No more annoying flicker in graph-X after plot is drawn (libplotX
	no longer clears window before redrawing, when closepl() is called).
alloca.c now supplied in ./ode directory for machines that don't have alloca.
Repeated calls to openpl..closepl in libplotps were producing
	incorrect %%DocumentFonts lines in the PS output; now fixed.
Closed polylines (final vertex = initial vertex) drawn with libplotps 
	now close correctly, as seen by a PS interpreter.
Widths of lines drawn with libplotps, as displayed by idraw, now agree with 
	the widths seen by a PS interpreter such as Ghostscript.  If lines
	now look too thick, use the zero-linewidth (`-W 0') option.
Octagonal markers added (markers #30 and #31).
Bug in special function code (used by ode), for machines that don't have
	them, now fixed (compilation of ode/specfun.c no longer bombs).
Hershey fonts now include Russian HersheyCyrillic, and HersheyEUC (for Japanese
	support; Hiragana, Katakana, and 603 Kanji are supported).
HersheyScript is now located in its own typeface; HersheySans-Oblique
	and HersheySans-BoldOblique created.
Ligature support added to certain Hershey fonts.
ISO-Latin-1 characters in Hershey fonts now include most accented
	characters.
Characters missing from Hershey fonts now print as an
	`undefined character' symbol (seven horizontal strokes).
Hershey astronomical and misc. symbols added.
Many miscellaneous cleanups to Hershey fonts 
	(inverted questionmark and exclamation point now supported, 
	for example; `asteriskmath' vertical height fixed, etc.).
plot.h now works with C++ as well as C

Version 1.1 released, 7/97
