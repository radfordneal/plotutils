This directory includes a few files in Tektronix format.  You may use them
to test the tek2plot utility, which translates Tektronix graphics commands
to graphics commands for other display devices.

The file ocpred.tek contains a chart showing an astronomical event of 1986,
prepared in 1985 at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  You
may do:

    tek2plot -Tps --font-name HersheyGothic-English ocpred.tek > ocpred.ps

to translate it to Postscript.  The text will be rendered in the specified
Old English font.  If you include the --position-chars option, each
character will be positioned individually, so as to match the position of
the corresponding character in the original Tektronix fixed-width font.

Similarly, you may do:

    tek2plot -Tps usmap.tek > usmap.ps

to prepare a Postscript version of the USA map.
