This directory includes a few files in Tektronix format.  You may use them
to test the tek2plot utility, which displays Tektronix files on other,
non-Tektronix, display devices.

The file ocpred.tek contains a chart showing an astronomical event of 1986,
prepared in 1985 at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  You
may do:

    tek2plot -Tps --font-name HersheyGothic-English ocpred.tek > ocpred.ps

to translate it to Postscript.  The text will be rendered in
HersheyGothic-English, which is an Old English font.  

HersheyGothic-English is not a fixed-width font, unlike the original
Tektronix font.  But if you add the `--position-chars' option on the
command line, each character will be positioned individually, so as to
match the position of the corresponding character in the original font.

Similarly, you may do:

    tek2plot -Tps usmap.tek > usmap.ps

to prepare a Postscript version of the USA map.
