This directory contains the source for the GNU tek2plot program, which
translates Tektronix graphics commands to graphics commands for other
display devices.  This program is not made by default; to make and install
it, you need to type `make' and `make install' in this directory.

The build process creates five versions of this program: tek2X, tek2ps,
tek2fig, tek2tek [redundant], and raw tek2plot [which produces output in a
GNU-enhanced version of the traditional plot(5) format].  They differ from
one another in the graphics device they are able to drive.  During the
build process, they are linked with different versions of GNU libplot.

tek2plot emulates the non-interactive features of a Tektronix 4014 with
extended graphics module (EGM), as described in the 4014 Service Manual
(Tektronix Part #070-1648-00, dated 8/74; there is also a User Manual [Part
#070-1647-00]).  We don't attempt to support interactive features, such as
GIN mode, status enquiry, or bypass mode.  We also don't support
write-through mode or beam defocusing.
   
tek2plot does emulate some features of other Tektronix 4014 emulators (see
comments in the code).

The subdirectory ./teksamples contains some old Tektronix files, of unknown
provenance, which may be used to test tek2plot.
